            <p bold="true">Every 30 days, from 12:00 to 00:00, a Horde Event takes place.</p>
            <p space="50">During this time, waves of Parasites will relentlessly come after you. The Hordes are challenging, and with each subsequent event, the difficulty intensifies. To survive, you'll need a well-fortified and stable base.</p>

            </page_title>

                <p>During this event, the spawn rate of regular mobs (excluding Parasites) increases significantly. Evolution Points will also rise due to the greater number of potential infestations. Additionally, sleeping is not possible during a Bloodmoon.</p>
